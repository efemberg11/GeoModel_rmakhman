# The 'GeoShiftUnion' GeoModel example

![](docs/assets/visualization-3318dc3d.png)

The `GeoShiftUnion` example shows you how to create a more complex geometry, by using the GeoShapeShift and GeoShiftUnion nodes.

The example program:

 1. Builds an example geometry:
 2. Writes the geometry to an SQLite file


## Run

You can run the example program by launching it from its "build" directory:

```
./GeoTessellatedSolidExamples/geoTessellatedExample
```

When the program terminates, you will find a `geometry.db` file in the build folder. This is a SQLite file containing the dump of the geometry defined in the example C++ code.
