# The 'helloGeoWriteReadWrite' GeoModel example

The `helloGeoWriteReadWrite` example shows you how to create a simple geometry, by using GeoModel nodes.

The example program:

 1. Builds an example geometry:
 2. Writes the geometry to an SQLite file
 3. It accesses the persistent copy of the geometry, as a test
 4. Reads it back 
 5. Stores it in a new sqlite file

## Build

To build the GeoModelExamples please refer to the documentation at [GeoModel website](https://geomodel.web.cern.ch/home/)

## Run

Now, you can **run the example** by typing:

```bash
./hellogeoWriteReadWrite
```
