# The 'helloGeoWrite' GeoModel example

The `helloGeoWrite` example shows you how to create a simple geometry, by using GeoModel nodes.

The example program:

 1. Builds an example geometry:
 2. Writes the geometry to an SQLite file
 3. It accesses the persistent copy of the geometry, as a test

## Build

To build the GeoModelExamples please refer to the documentation at [GeoModel website](https://geomodel.web.cern.ch/home/)


## Run

Now, you can **run the example** by typing:

```bash
./hellogeoWrite
```
