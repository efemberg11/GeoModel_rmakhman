# GeoModel - A Detector Description Toolkit for HEP experiments


GeoModel is a **complete toolkit** to write and manage the **detector description** for High Energy Physics experiments.


## Intro

The GeoModel Toolkit offers classes that provide geometrical primitives for describing detectors, as well as a set of tools for writing, accessing, handling, manipulating, dumping, restoring, visualizing, inspecting, and debugging the detector geometry.

GeoModel also offers many **memory-saving techniques** which lets developers to optimally describe their detectors while keeping the memory footprint very low.

GeoModel is a **pure C++ toolkit** with only **minimal and ligthweight external dependencies**.

The GeoModel Toolkit is also **highly modular**: 

you can pick the modules and tools you need, and **you will use only what you really need**, without the fear of introducing extra external potentially heavyweight dependencies when not needed.

## Features

### Geometry Description

A complete set of shapes and geometrical primitives to describe your detector's geometry

A set of 'nodes' to build your detector tree

### Alignment

A smart mechanism to handle detector alignment, with multiple alignment costants kept in cache and synchronized


### Virtual Geometry / Surfaces

Tools to describe and handle 2D surfaces as part of a Virtual Geometry, which can be placed and misaligned alongside the regular, full geometry

Very useful to describe a simplified Tracking Geometry and still move and handle together with the full geometry

### Visualization 

A complete, **interactive visualization** tool to check, inspect, debug your detector geometry in an easy way

### GDML support

An **exporter** to export a GeoModel geometry into GDML

An **importer** to import a GDML geometry into GeoModel *(work in progress)*

### Standalone Detector Simulation

#### Easy Geant4-based simulation 

An **interactive graphical interface** to steer a standalone Geant4-based simulation of your detector, to get quick feedback on your detector while you're still working on it

#### Clash Detection & Visualization

Standalone tools to identify clash points and overlaps between geometry volumes with a fast Geant4-based algorithm

Interactive visualization of clash points in the standalone GeoModel visualization module

#### Volume Computation

Methods to compute the volume of all shapes, included Boolean shapes, and store it in the GeoModel I/O file for later use

#### Mass calculation

A standalone **mass calculator tool**, to quickly compute the masses of your detector from the command line

#### Geantino Maps

A standalone tool to **generate geantino maps** of your newly built detector



The GeoModel Toolkit includes:

* **gmex**, the geometry explorer, an interactive 3D geometry visualizer
* **gmstatistics**, tool to monitor the memory consumption
* **fullsimlight**, a command-line tool to run experiment agnostic Geant4 simulation, and its graphical user interface, *fsl*.
* **gmclash**, a Geant4 based command-line tool to perform clash detection
* **gmgeantino**, a Geant4 based command-line tool to generate geantino maps
* **gmmasscalc**, a Geant4 based command-line tool to compute the mass of a given piece of detector geometry
* **gm2gdml** and **gdml2gm**, command line tools to convert GeoModel to and from GDML
* **gmcat**, a command line tool to assemble geometry from multiple inputs

## External Dependencies

The GeoModel Toolkit offers C++ classes that provide geometrical primitives for describing detector geometry (e.g., shapes, logical/physical volumes, transformations), as well as a set of tools for writing, accessing, handling, manipulating, dumping, restoring, visualizing, inspecting, and debugging detector geometries.

- The [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org) math library for the core packages

Additional external dependencies:

- The lighweight [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) file-based database for I/O, when the `I/O` module is used

- The Apache [`Xerces-C`](https://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/) XML parser library, when the XML interface of the `Tools` module is used
- The open-source ("Community") version of the [Qt graphics framework](https://www.qt.io/) for the GUI, when the `Visualization` module is used
- The [Coin](https://github.com/coin3d/coin) and [SoQt](https://github.com/coin3d/soqt) libraries for 3D graphics, when the `Visualization` module is used
